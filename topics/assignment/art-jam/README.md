## Description

Self Portrait is an interactive digital artwork created with p5.js. It represents aspects of my identity and interests: my love for the winters of QuÃ©bec and my fondness for frogs.

The piece depicts a cute yellow frog with sparkling star-shaped eyes and blushing cheeks, standing joyfully on a snowy ice lake. Behind it, stylized geometric evergreen mountains form the background. Snowflakes drift down around the frog, landing playfully on its face, body, and the icy ground.

Controls
    > Pressed the mouse to make frog eyes blinking
    > Move the mouse to change the color of frog cheek's line.
