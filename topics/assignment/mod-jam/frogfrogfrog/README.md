## Description

Hungry Frog is an interactive digital mini-game created with p5.js.

Your goal is simple: within 15 seconds, catch as many flies as you can with your frog’s tongue!

🎮 Controls
    > Press and hold the mouse — Start the game
    > Move the mouse — Control the frog’s position 
    > Click — Launch the frog’s tongue
    > Catch flies — Earn points and trigger combos
    > Press any key — Turn the current fly into a bomb for a second player
    > Combo & Score System — Unlock fun emojis as your score increases
    > Game Over? — You can always play again!

🎨 Design Details
    > The frog’s mouth gradually grows to start the game
    > The game ends automatically after 15 seconds
    > The fly moves in a sine-wave pattern with random positions 
    > A second player can transform the fly into a bomb
    > The fly has visual effects — flapping wings and dynamic color changes 
    > The frog’s eyes follow the fly’s movement 
    > The frog visually “eats” the fly and pulls it back into its mouth
    > A score bar displays your progress and total score
