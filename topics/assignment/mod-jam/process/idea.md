<!-- mod-jam ideas -->

Game Start:
-Click the frog to start the game. (What does the frog look like? What kind of frog should it be? How can I change the screen from the frog to the main game? Can I make the frog grow to start the game? Before the game screen appears, can I add a black loading screen?)

-Click the fly to start the game. (Create a random fly on the screen. Once the fly is clicked, the game starts.
Or, I can add eyes to the frog — the eyes will follow the fly’s movement.)

-Hold down and release to make the frog’s mouth grow larger until it reaches the edge of the canvas — this starts the game. (How can I make the frog’s mouth grow? How can I create an opening animation? Should I use an if statement for this?)

-Click on an empty area to make the frog blink and start the game. (Make the frog’s eyes interactive — when the eyes blink five times, the game starts. How can I count the number of blinks? Or would it be better to use a timer to track the blinking?)

-Add a “Start” button for the game. (Where should I place the start button? What kind of button should I use? Should I make the button a text emoji?)

Game End:
-The game ends with different frog emojis based on your score.(How do I add different emojis in code? How do I track the score? Where should I show the emoji? Which emoji represents high vs. low scores—maybe a “hungry frog” vs. a “full frog”?)

-If you achieve a high score, the game ends with a clean-river scene.(Maybe animate a clean river to show that you “ate all the flies.” If you didn’t eat all the flies, leave a few flies in the sky.)

-When the game ends, the frog moves away.(How do I make the frog disappear? What transition should I use?)

-The game ends if you miss three or five flies.(Make the game harder by ending quickly—you can’t miss many flies. How do I count missed flies? How do I track both score and misses?)

-At the end, the frog jumps across the leaves and walks away.(How do I animate the jump? How do I make it smooth and look realistic—do I need a set distance?)

Scoring System:
-Display the score in the top corner or at the center.(What color or font should I use? Can I make it more interesting? Besides numbers, can I use other elements?)

-When the frog eats a fly, a score popup briefly appears next to the disappearing fly.(How do I make this happen? How do I attach the popup to that fly’s position? Should I also add a general score tracker at the bottom?)

-Each time a fly is eaten, show the total number of flies caught next to the frog.(What about using frog icons as tally marks? Or a life system? If I add lives, how do I track them—lose one life when a fly is missed?)

-Include a “measurement-tape” style progress bar that changes color based on flies caught.(Is the tape just a rectangle? How do I change its length/color as flies increase? Should filling the tape mean the player wins?)

-At the end of the game, show the final score.(Number score or letter grade? Should the color change with performance?)

New Design Features:
-Add a sound effect when the frog catches a fly.(What kind of sound should I use for the frog? How can I add it into the code? Do I need to add a sound when a fly is missed?)

-Change the eye expression when the frog eats a fly. (When the frog eats a fly, should the eyes turn into heart shapes? When the frog eats nothing, should the eyes look sad?)

-Add a sound effect when the frog opens its mouth.(What kind of sound should I use for the frog? How can I add it into the code? Can I include this sound in the game start sequence? Should the sound change as the mouth opens?)

-Modify the fly colors and movement patterns to make them more dynamic.(Does the fly need to be round all the time? Can the fly change color continuously? Can I use another shape to represent the fly?)

-Allow the frog’s tongue to move when a keyboard key is pressed.(How can I make the tongue move using the keyboard? How can I increase the tongue’s speed? What would be the best speed for the tongue to catch the fly?)

-Add a visual effect to show that the fly is being eaten by the frog.(How can I make this effect work? How can I make it smooth? How can I animate the “eating” motion?)

-Introduce randomly appearing flies to increase difficulty and variety.(How should the flies move — up and down, or appear randomly? Should they disappear and reappear over time? Can I make some flies larger or smaller?)

-Add a “bad apple” (a bomb) — the player must avoid eating it. (What kind of “bad apple” should I add? Should I use a bomb instead of an apple? How can I set the distance and track the bomb? If the player touches the bomb, should the score go down?)
