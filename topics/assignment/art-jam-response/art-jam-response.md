Tittle : Art Jam Response

1.Sean Gregory's Art Jam (https://seangregoryv8.github.io/cart253/assignments/art-jam)

This is an incredible self-portrait to me, and it only took Sean several hours to complete this amazing work. I felt really stressed after I saw his project because he used a lot of user interactions in his code. Every time you click on one of his facial features, it changes. If you don’t click the eyes, they will blink automatically. This made me wonder how he did it. What inspired me most was how he built the pixel art in JavaScript by turning the canvas into a grid., so he only needed to place the points within the grid. I think this approach is really helpful when making artwork on the canvas. His files are very clear and easy to understand because he separated each part into individual files, making the main script short and organized. He linked all the files together using the script "src" tags. I admire his organized coding style, which helps me gain new knowledge on how to structure my own code better.

2.Ahmad AlRazzaz's Art Jam (https://ahmadalrazzaz.github.io/cart253/art-jam/)

This is a funny self-portrait. He created a really interesting interaction for his work. His project vividly shows what it’s like to stay up late — the eyes turn red, it gets dark, he feels sleepy (the eyes get smaller), and when it becomes light again, he wakes up and opens his eyes. It’s a really funny way to represent himself.He did a great job using all of the code we learned in class. The way he made the pupils follow the hand by using mouseX and mouseY, and constrained the distance to make sure the pupils stay within the eyes, is very clever. His code is simple and clear, which makes it easy to understand how he built this project. He also used well-written if statements to make the eyes open and close.I think he did a really great job. Through his project, I can see that he clearly understands all the material we learned in class. I also think his project helped me review all the material that I learned.
