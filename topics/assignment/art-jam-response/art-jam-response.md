Tittle : Art Jam Response
Author: Weini WANG

1. Sean Gregory's Art Jam (https://seangregoryv8.github.io/cart253/assignments/art-jam)

This is an incredible self-portrait to me, and it only took Sean several hours to complete this amazing work. I felt really stressed after I saw his project because he used a lot of user interactions in his code. Every time you click on one of his facial features, it changes. If you donâ€™t click the eyes, they will blink automatically. This made me wonder how he did it. What inspired me most was how he built the pixel art in JavaScript by turning the canvas into a grid., so he only needed to place the points within the grid. I think this approach is really helpful when making artwork on the canvas. His files are very clear and easy to understand because he separated each part into individual files, making the main script short and organized. He linked all the files together using the script "src" tags. I admire his organized coding style, which helps me gain new knowledge on how to structure my own code better.
