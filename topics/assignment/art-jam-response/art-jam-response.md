Tittle : Art Jam Response

1.Sean Gregory's Art Jam (https://seangregoryv8.github.io/cart253/assignments/art-jam)

This is an incredible self-portrait to me, and it only took Sean several hours to complete this amazing work. I felt really stressed after I saw his project because he used a lot of user interactions in his code. Every time you click on one of his facial features, it changes. If you don’t click the eyes, they will blink automatically. This made me wonder how he did it. What inspired me most was how he built the pixel art in JavaScript by turning the canvas into a grid., so he only needed to place the points within the grid. I think this approach is really helpful when making artwork on the canvas. His files are very clear and easy to understand because he separated each part into individual files, making the main script short and organized. He linked all the files together using the script "src" tags. I admire his organized coding style, which helps me gain new knowledge on how to structure my own code better.

This is a funny self-portrait. He created a really interesting interaction for his work. His project vividly shows what it’s like to stay up late — the eyes turn red, it gets dark, he feels sleepy (the eyes get smaller), and when it becomes light again, he wakes up and opens his eyes. It’s a really funny way to represent himself.He did a great job using all of the code we learned in class. The way he made the pupils follow the hand by using mouseX and mouseY, and constrained the distance to make sure the pupils stay within the eyes, is very clever. His code is simple and clear, which makes it easy to understand how he built this project. He also used well-written if statements to make the eyes open and close.I think he did a really great job. Through his project, I can see that he clearly understands all the material we learned in class. I also think his project helped me review all the material that I learned.

This is an interesting self-portrait. It represents different levels of a shy guy. He used a lot of if statements and booleans in his code to create user interaction. It is a really cute design. These simple elements create an emotional connection by letting users control how shy or exposed the character feels, which really surprised me. He used clear comments in his code to explain the logic behind the interactions, such as toggling the light and dragging the curtain. After checking his code, I learned a new feature in p5.js — the erase() function. It can create a blank space on the canvas. I was wondering how he made the user see the character after turning off the light, and now I understand. I think this is a very useful feature that I can use in the future. Through his code, I also noticed that he used several console.log statements to test and debug his logic. It shows how challenging it was to make the if statements work, and how much console.log helped him in the process.
