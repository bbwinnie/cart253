This is a really interesting game. Abhi transformed the original concept into a Pokémon fighting game, which is a unique and creative idea. I really like this version, and I was curious about how he added pictures into the code. By reviewing his code, I discovered that images are added in a similar way to how sounds are implemented — by preloading the images and using functions to position and size them. This technique will definitely help me when I add images to my next project.
He also created a clear instruction page to help players understand how to play the game, which makes the gameplay experience much easier to follow. However, I think the instruction page could be improved by adding a return button to go back to the main page, since it’s a little confusing to start the game after reading the instructions.
Additionally, I think he could make the game more engaging by changing the fly’s movement pattern. I also learned from his code how to use the arrow keys to move the fly — I initially thought it required the keyPressed() function, but it actually uses keyIsDown() to make it work smoothly. Lastly, I think he should add more comments in his code to make it easier for others to read and understand.
